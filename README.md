So, your task is to find the fastest student and display her/his name on console. Therefore, you have to write method, which will take some input (Array? Of which type?) and return smth (index?). Is it look like bubble sort? Are there any other ways to solve it? Also, you have to sort them out.
And then you have to try to find the second fastest student and so on.
Following information could be helpful:
How to declare array for strings and integers:
String[] names = {values goes here};
int[] times = {values goes here};Some pseudocode for sorting algorithm:
for (i between 0 and n-1) {
     for (j between i+1 and n-1) {
          if (time[i] > time[j]) {
               switch time[i] and time[j]
               switch names[i] and names[j]
          }
} }
There are different ways to solve this task.
And in your method, you have to receive an array, and return some int value. Usage of google is welcome. Do not forget to add comments whenever they are necessary.
